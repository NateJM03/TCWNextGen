This directory holds offline map files for the NexradViewer application.

For production use, this directory should contain:
1. A usa_base.png file for the base map of the United States
2. OR a set of .png files for different map regions

The application will automatically use these map files when available,
otherwise it will fallback to OSM maps which require internet connectivity.
